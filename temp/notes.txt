Should prepare locale later to use (Remember space is nauvis now, check all, descs too)
-- NOTE: !!! Remember descriptions/localised_description etc in all, and that one turret thing


AAA UPDATE RAINBOWORE !!!
^ crafting_machine_tint ?? Small misc tidy too perhaps

-- ??? Could not load source '@__factoryplanner__/backend/data/ModuleSet.lua'.
-- ^ look into fixing maybe, or just hide instead of nil

-- Instead of ribbon world, just super distant resources? (OR JUST PLAY DEFAULT IDK)

TODO
rainbowore release + craft tints for rainborore (Just for known types)
attempt fix factoryplanner
wincon 1b tech?



-- !!! Maybe look into making a tips-n-tricks page for the mod? At least about the science/quality changes?
-- !!! Delete all other tips? Maybe make part of the hide/nil config if end up adding that (delete tips if deleting prototypes)

--Also arcosphere??

Locale New: Any mod settings, possibly the nil things.

May update med/small prom asteroid desc in factpedia, and other descs? (tnt instead)
