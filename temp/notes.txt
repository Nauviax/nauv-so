Also need to give promethium a glowup, make LG darker or something

(Reminder to try and reuse any intermediates made for other sciences (at least))

(Lightened HGProm could probably have an overlay layer thing of some sort, a plus or smth)
 - Or am I darkening the LG texture?

planetary makes data (dimmed pack icon)
space makes fluid (simple + local, colored)
pack == data + fluid + lgPrometh


science base (grey) = water + thruster fuel  + steel + lgprom(small)
advanced science base = base + petroleum + wood + cwire + lgprom(small)
NOTE for locals, ensure ~ same rocket capacity as well as cost
w = base + uran
v = base + carbide
f = base + conductor
g = base + biofux

a = advbase + fluoro (noprod, small consume)
p = advbase + pentegg

pack recipies take variable data, pack stack 50, data stack 400(8-1),200(2-1),50(2-1) depending on type (Meaning F1-1, N2-1, V1-2 stack diffs)
(all take similar relatively quick time, aquilo x5)
    (As going w 5x expensive, x5 time to make 1 pack of old?)
     10/2 per 1.5 (3), aquilo 20/2 per 1 (10). Assuming packs in cryo, 30e(15s) and 150e(75s)

fluids made in chem or cryo, take long time
packs in assemb or cryo, relatively quick, all take lgprom and data (gleb should get lgprom discount)


5000 in rocket
work out coal/astroids rockets needed for same, ideally lot less (petro) (pre-aquilo)}
!!! ^ for all petrochem, ensure barrels aren't just better/easier
(Nerf barrel per rocket, aside from fluoro?)


---


orange low stack size, require higher storage amnt (data 50 inst 200), maybe weightx2?
purple require large amnt, but make lots too (req 20 inst 5, weight/4, stack 400)
blue have long craft time, long journey anyway (x5?)

all packs stack 50, tech costs all /5? (assume pack 5x expensive (data more like x7 due to prod on data->pack)) (Likely also need to data weight x5 as well) (pack weight to be consistent, make same as data?)
^ Tech duration x5 as well
(Apply to all, but try to avoid changing own techs (Do before these) (Probably after pack removals tho)
Starting techs use dcards? Would need to make these items into tools afaik

DATA
N stack 200, rocket 1000, 2 per SP, 500PPR and 100PPS
V stack 50, rocket 500, 2 per SP, 250PPR and 25PPS
F stack 400, rocket 4000, 8 per SP, 500PPR and 50 PPS (Also lots of item)
G=N
A=N but 5x craft times
P=N but 2x craft times (and egg)

BASED ON TECH /5
1 rocket launch for fluid intermediate to 1 launches of data
Assume 1000 data per rocket for nauvis -> 500 science (ie pre weight changes to data to make heavier maybe maybe)
(1 Liq craft is 2 packs)
N (D1000e2=500, I20) 500P, 250L, means 12.5 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Thus should consume 1/12.5 per L, or 0.08 per L (0.04 per pack)
V (D500e2=250, I500) 250P, 125L, mean 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Start 3 carbide for 0.75 rockets
F (D4000e8, I1000) 500P, 250L, mean 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Start 4 condct for match, these are p cheap
G (D1000e2=500, I1000) 500P, 250L, mean 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Bio is weird, so just 1 for 0.25 rocket per (Need account that spoilage is hard, even if planet is free)
A gonna be weird, and needs to take in >1 AND return some. Maybe join w nauvis and make 2 diff params instead of 1 and seeing if >1 !!!(Do an in and out)
A (D1000e2=500, I5000) 500P, 250L, means 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - So consume 4 to match? fair fair
P (Penta egg weight is 200pr instead of 500pr. Vanilla pack takes 1 begg per pack, so likely take half of what I use in egg?)

inf techs
statpack assume free, rest % divvied over various techs. Assign pack as needed. (These start at planet levels)
mining x5 pre prometh, get to 100% @ 20% per, but prometh scale x2 per upgrade. (Harsher % amounts?)

Railgun damage 2 for prometh, 6 for big stomper (so close tho, the 2 in -2/50% makes it 5->6)
+40% per, so need 240% (201% really) for both. (prom just the 2 still, 80%)
Maybe split damage between turret and ammo, so turret does more? Nerfs demolisher killing too (What cost is 6 normally anyway?)
If splitting, make tech5 level, or lower. (Remember +20% and +20% is +44% total! +100% and +100% is +300%)


speed caps at 10 (+200%) (0.5 at A, 1.5 at P? Look into what %s makes numbers nice.)


1p cost = 1
3p cost = 2
ap cost = 2.5
pp cost = 3

y=1\cdot\left(600\left(1.5^{x}-1.5^{x-l}\right)\right) (Max rounded up to 50s)
assuming 200 base, 300L1 (From 1000b,1500L1)(Side note, remember to adjust labprod tech)
 0->20 = 750                  | 500
20->40 = 1700  (/2 = 850)     | 1000
40->60 = 3800  (/2.5 = 1500)  | 1500
60->80 = 8550  (/3 = 2850)    | 2500
80->100= 19250 (/3 = 6400)    | 5000

60->100= 27800 (/3 = 9250)    | X




!!! Change win condition to a 1B prom tech? Maybe?



!!! Ensure recipe order items is good, see cryo fluid as weak forgetful example (new on top?)
