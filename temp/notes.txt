Compare prom packs per huge prometh in old and using new (lg and hg), ideally similar (remember account for x5 costs)
-- Doesn't seem to bad in game, but still compare

!!! Consider mass rename space pack to nauvis pack, !!_internally_!! (Would need to do locale after)



---


!!! Change win condition to a 1B prom tech? Maybe?



Need sort item order in TECHS !!!
Check all new recipies and see if need crafting tints (!!! Also do for rainborore later?)


Should prepare locale later to use (Remember space is nauvis now, check all, descs too)
-- NOTE: !!! Remember descriptions/localised_description etc in all, and that one turret thing

-- Promethium-147 balance in very early game, investigate (may be fine as-is)


AAA UPDATE RAINBOWORE !!!
^ crafting_machine_tint ?? Small misc tidy too perhaps

-- ??? Could not load source '@__factoryplanner__/backend/data/ModuleSet.lua'.
-- ^ look into fixing maybe, or just hide instead of nil

-- Instead of ribbon world, just super distant resources? (OR JUST PLAY DEFAULT IDK)

TODO
balance recipies (Almost done)
order of unlocks in each tech
balance railgun handheld *maybe*
locale (nauvispack) (Fix rail turret bonus too)
rainbowore release + craft tints
attempt fix factoryplanner
wincon 1b tech?

-- PHONE NOTES

Ideally promethium scarce enough to warrant not crafting base at same time as packs. Too much prometh and we can just do both.
- (Tho both still requires double the crusher right? Maybe current is fine, player may choose less crushers)
- Ideally small early ships process 3-4 rockets of data on way back. Larger later ships closer to 12-16 rockets of data?
- ^ (Aquilo distance just assume fine maybe, tho it IS like triple required. But also asteroid productivity)

Balance non-prom asteroid material in early game. (Later-game is probably ok anyway)
