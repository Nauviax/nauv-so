NOTE the below prom-147 section is a little outdated, code is source of truth
HG prometh may want icon?
Also want nosat powder icon. Look through SA textures? (Uranium ore but red, likely)
Use powder in recipies, 1a->20p+0.2a, (around 1a->25p after a) (now 10 not 20)
If recipe used 0.5, is now 10 powder.
If recipe used 0.75, is now 5 powder. (No outs btw)
-- May lower to 6 and 3 ? Though pro
-- NOTE this would be affected by prod, including tech prod @ 100%
-- ^^^ (!!! Does this include the 0.2a?? It seems like it DOES, meaning way more P per A) (!!! TEST, though research seems it's fair game)
-- Normal crush energy is 2s or 5s for adv, so prom take 5? Will need to test ingame as usual.
-- !!! Gleba science should require less prometh in pack/data craft due to spoilage
(just 1 for gleb maybe, adjust crush output to account for that? Spoilage reasons)
1 gleb, 2 norm, 3 for A, 4 for P (LG not in data, just pack)
1pp for basic, 2pp(3tot) for advanced
vulc to nauv enough for 4 rockets of data? (assume no base)
large ship + prod enough for 16? Test Aquilo level, prometh likely fine

Compare prom packs per huge prometh in old and using new (lg and hg), ideally similar (remember account for x5 costs)


petrochem balance for adv base
5000 in rocket
work out coal/astroids rockets needed for same, ideally lot less (petro) (pre-aquilo)}
!!! ^ for all petrochem, ensure barrels aren't just better/easier
(Nerf barrel per rocket, aside from fluoro?)

BASED ON TECH /5
1 rocket launch for fluid intermediate to 1 launches of data
Assume 1000 data per rocket for nauvis -> 500 science (ie pre weight changes to data to make heavier maybe maybe)
(1 Liq craft is 2 packs)
N (D1000e2=500, I20) 500P, 250L, means 12.5 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Thus should consume 1/12.5 per L, or 0.08 per L (0.04 per pack)
V (D500e2=250, I500) 250P, 125L, mean 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Start 3 carbide for 0.75 rockets
F (D4000e8, I1000) 500P, 250L, mean 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Start 4 condct for match, these are p cheap
G (D1000e2=500, I1000) 500P, 250L, mean 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - Bio is weird, so just 1 for 0.25 rocket per (Need account that spoilage is hard, even if planet is free)
A gonna be weird, and needs to take in >1 AND return some. Maybe join w nauvis and make 2 diff params instead of 1 and seeing if >1 !!!(Do an in and out)
A (D1000e2=500, I5000) 500P, 250L, means 0.25 rockets to match 1 data if 1 per
 - So consume 4 to match? fair fair
P (Penta egg weight is 200pr instead of 500pr. Vanilla pack takes 1 begg per pack, so likely take half of what I use in egg?)

!!! Change win condition to a 1B prom tech? Maybe?



!!! Ensure recipe order items is good, see cryo fluid as weak forgetful example (new on top?)
^ also this factoriopedia wrong tab/

Need sort item order in recipies AND TECHS !!!
Check all new recipies and see if need tints (Also do for rainborore later?)



Should prepare locale later to use (Remember space is nauvis now, check all, descs too)
-- NOTE: !!! Remember descriptions/localised_description etc in all




-- !!! STILL NEED TO ADD MED PROMETH TO ASTEROID BELT AREAS between planets (Will also need to review balance)
^ !!! Needs to be far enough from planet to avoid pulsing thruster cheese (10%?)



!!! AAAAAA Need to add more stuff to packs
V Ref concrete, engines (many), LDS?
F FlyFrame, more SConductors? (Tricky as already p good recipe)
G Explosives and Lube
A ??? More oil stuff, also something to require either more ice(water) or ammonia (Whichever makes voiding the other easier)
P Swap qProc with split ABC idea, 20a5b5c, takes b, spoildown2m, c recycle/craft back into qproc or more a? (Craft before rot, and does fresh reset too?)

-- !!! Max double check ignored_by_productivity via debug log maybe? (It should set to ignored_by_stats) (Just where used) 
-- !!! Also see pinned clipboard

AAA UPDATE RAINBOWORE
^ crafting_machine_tint ?? Small misc tidy too perhaps
