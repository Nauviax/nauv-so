NOTE the below prom-147 section is a little outdated, code is source of truth
--  (!!! Does chunk crushing include the 0.2a?? It seems like it DOES, meaning way more P per A) (!!! TEST, though research seems it's fair game)

vulc to nauv enough for 4 rockets of data? (assume no base)
large ship + prod enough for 16? Test Aquilo level, prometh likely fine

Compare prom packs per huge prometh in old and using new (lg and hg), ideally similar (remember account for x5 costs)

!!!!!!!!!!! Consider mass rename space pack to nauvis pack, internally (Would need to do locale after)










---


!!! Change win condition to a 1B prom tech? Maybe?



!!! Ensure recipe order items is good, see cryo fluid as weak forgetful example (new on top?)
^ also this factoriopedia wrong tab/

Need sort item order in recipies AND TECHS !!! (Just techs now)
Check all new recipies and see if need tints (Also do for rainborore later?)



Should prepare locale later to use (Remember space is nauvis now, check all, descs too)
-- NOTE: !!! Remember descriptions/localised_description etc in all



-- !!! STILL NEED TO balance MED PROMETH TO ASTEROID BELT AREAS between planets (Will also need to review balance)




AAA UPDATE RAINBOWORE
^ crafting_machine_tint ?? Small misc tidy too perhaps

-- ??? Could not load source '@__factoryplanner__/backend/data/ModuleSet.lua'.

-- Instead of ribbon world, just super distant resources? (OR JUST PLAY DEFAULT IDK)
-- Likely just do x5 sci, more than that seems artificial

TODO
balance recipies
order, subgroups (new space?) (Recipe item order too!) (May just be tech left now)
locale (nauvispack) (Fix rail turret bonus too)
rainbowore release + craft tints
attempt fix factoryplanner
wincon 1b tech?
