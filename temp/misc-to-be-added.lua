-- Handheld railgun nerf (Encourage high qual ammo) (!!! Don't much like doing this tho, unrelated to mod this is)
data.raw.gun["railgun"].attack_parameters.damage_modifier = 0.25 -- Too much?
-- !!! Test latest changes first against demplishers pre and post prometh, dmg put turrets instead so may feel less cheaty now. (Test also w rare ammo)



-- !!! Change win condition to a 1B prom tech?


-- !!! Maybe look into making a tips-n-tricks page for the mod? At least about the science/quality changes?
-- !!! Delete all other tips? Maybe make part of the hide/nil config if end up adding that (delete tips if deleting prototypes)

--Also arcosphere??
