-- Handheld railgun nerf (Encourage high qual ammo) (!!! Don't like doing this tho, unrelated to mod this is)
data.raw.gun["railgun"].attack_parameters.damage_modifier = 0.25 -- Too much?
-- Put dmg into turrets instead (!!!)






-- !!!!! Change win condition to a 1B prom tech?


-- !!! Maybe look into making a tips-n-tricks page for the mod? At least about the science/quality changes?
-- !!! Delete all other tips




-- Need to calculate sum of remaining other stat bonuses. Shoot speed likely can be a single tech at relevant pack. (Railgun speed could have 2, one at prom?)
-- inf damage should cap at a nice number, using pack and aquilo
-- Railgun upgrades put at promethium?? Enough speed to hit turret speed cap possibly, and enough damage (not a level more) to 1 hit asteroids. (Unsure about large stompers though? Maybe give bonuses only to turret?)
-- ^ If making railgun upgrades at prom, aquilo may need something extra. (Perhaps leave some speed at aquilo. Is lv0 enough to 1 hit normal huge asteroids? Look into breakpoints.)

-- I think a good damage cap would be values <100k science? Check it out first.
-- Would put half and half (3 and A)

-- Follower bots probably just double each time. 50->100->200 (what is normal tech cost for 200 total?)




-- double artillerty damage means nauv 1 shot



-- !!! Review scrap balance at end !!!
--Also arcosphere??
