[item-name]
promethium-147=Promethium-147
high-grade-promethium-asteroid-chunk=High-grade promethium asteroid chunk
fresh-data=Blank data card
garbage-data=Garbage data card
space-data=Automation data
metallurgic-data=Metalurgic data
agricultural-data=Agricultural data
electromagnetic-data=Electromagnetic data
cryogenic-data=Cryogenic data
promethium-data=Promethium data

[item-description]
promethium-147=Used in all forms of science production. Promethium can be collected while traveling between planets.
high-grade-promethium-asteroid-chunk=An asteroid chunk only found in large asteroids near the shattered planet.
fresh-data=Required to create science data.
garbage-data=Can be recycled to reclaim some parts.
space-data=Used to make automation science packs. Also used in labs for some early game researches.
metallurgic-data=Used to make metalurgic science packs. Very heavy, requiring extra rocket launches and cargo capacity to store.
agricultural-data=Used to make agricultural science packs. Despite being a data card, this item still spoils.
electromagnetic-data=Used to make electromagnetic science packs. Small and light, being created and consumed in large amounts.
cryogenic-data=Used to make cryogenic science packs. Cryogenic processes are slow, so both data and pack craft times are high.
promethium-data=Used to make promethium science packs. Requires high-grade promethium, found near the shattered planet.
