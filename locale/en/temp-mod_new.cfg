[item-name]
nso-promethium-147=Promethium-147
nso-hg-promethium-asteroid-chunk=High-grade promethium asteroid chunk
nso-blank-data=Blank data card
nso-garbage-data=Garbage data card
nso-space-data=Automation data
nso-metallurgic-data=Metalurgic data
nso-agricultural-data=Agricultural data
nso-electromagnetic-data=Electromagnetic data
nso-cryogenic-data=Cryogenic data
nso-promethium-data=Promethium data

[item-description]
nso-promethium-147=Used in all forms of science production. Promethium can be collected while traveling between planets.
nso-hg-promethium-asteroid-chunk=An asteroid chunk only found in large asteroids near the shattered planet.
nso-blank-data=Required to create science data.
nso-garbage-data=Can be recycled to reclaim some parts.
nso-space-data=Used to make automation science packs. Also used in labs for some early game researches.
nso-metallurgic-data=Used to make metalurgic science packs. Very heavy, requiring extra rocket launches and cargo capacity to store.
nso-agricultural-data=Used to make agricultural science packs. Despite being a data card, this item still spoils.
nso-electromagnetic-data=Used to make electromagnetic science packs. Small and light, being created and consumed in large amounts.
nso-cryogenic-data=Used to make cryogenic science packs. Cryogenic processes are slow, so both data and pack craft times are high.
nso-promethium-data=Used to make promethium science packs. Requires high-grade promethium, found near the shattered planet.

[asteroid-chunk-name]
