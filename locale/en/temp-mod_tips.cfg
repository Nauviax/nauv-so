[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
nso-title=Welcome to NSO!\n\nNSO is a medium-sized overhaul to science in Space Age, which aims to require the player to build larger and more complex factories without adding too many new intermediates. The ones added in this mod are only used in science production, so other areas of your bases will play the same.\n\nAll vanilla packs have been merged into one, and each pack now requires a much larger variety of ingredients to make. Don't be put off by the large costs of each pack, the cost of every tech is now much lower to compensate. Overall, you will still require more raw material than vanilla, along with a much larger base and significantly more complex space platforms.\n\nThe rest of the tips here will give a quick rundown of what has changed, and will include important notes that may not be obvious from Factoriopedia.\n\nThis mod is a work in progress. All recipe ingredients are basically final by now, but ingredient amounts, crafting times, and item/entity properties are all subject to balance changes in future updates. Ideally nothing that will break existing factories, but your ratios may change.\n\nMod compatability is low and customizability is non-existent. I'd like to change this one day, but for now it isn't a high priority unless NSO randomly becomes popular.\n\nThank you for trying out NSO. Please do give feedback via the Factorio mod portal, or reach out to me (Nauviax) on Discord.
nso-data=All science packs are made on space platforms, each planet produces and exports data cards instead. You can find all new and old science-related items in [item-group=space]. Data cards take in [item=nso-blank-data], [fluid=nso-science-gel], and some ingredients tied to that pack. Keep an eye on what buildings each item can be made in, as some have multiple options.\n\nEach card has unique properties to seperate it from the Nauvis card [item=nso-space-data]:\n - [item=nso-metallurgic-data] is heavy and large, requiring more rocket launches and storage space.\n - [item=nso-electromagnetic-data] is light and small, but is produced and consumed in larger quantities.\n - [item=nso-agricultural-data] still spoils, and requires SIGNIFICANTLY more fruit and nut to produce.\n - [item=nso-cryogenic-data] is slow to produce, with very long craft times at all stages.\n - [item=nso-promethium-data] is large and more expensive, but also MUST be made near the shattered planet instead of smuggling chunks back to Nauvis.\n\n[item=nso-blank-data] is a relatively simple recipe, and the intent is mainly to provide a set of items that all planets must produce. Nothing stops you from exporting them to other planets, but the intent is local production. (Even for Promethium packs! Though this would be tricker.)\nPack production will return [item=nso-garbage-data] which can be recycled to recover small amounts of material. Before unlocking recycling, these will need to either be dropped to a planet for storage, or just tossed into space.\n\n[fluid=nso-science-gel] has different recipes on each planet, including a space one for promethium packs. Each recipe will take some local items and a varying amount of [fluid=lubricant], [fluid=sulfuric-acid], and [item=plastic-bar]. Each craft creates enough gel for 2 packs before productivity, so don't be intimidated by the high input counts.\nLater packs swap out lube for other fluids, and require [item=wood] instead of plastic. Wood production has been significantly buffed on Nauvis; expect around 1 wood per second per tower. (Though do note that wood now spoils.)\nGel recipes: [recipe=nso-science-gel-space], [recipe=nso-science-gel-metallurgic], [recipe=nso-science-gel-electromagnetic], [recipe=nso-science-gel-agricultural], [recipe=nso-science-gel-cryogenic], and [recipe=nso-science-gel-promethium].
nso-packs=All science packs are made on space platforms, requiring data cards, [fluid=nso-space-slurry] and [item=nso-promethium-147]. Platforms will require a decent bit more power due to the larger crafting chains, so the output of ice from [item=oxide-asteroid-chunk] has been increased slightly to make nuclear power easier to implement.\n\n[fluid=nso-space-slurry] is basically equivilent to the original space science packs, being made from early game asteroid materials. It is used in all science packs, though later packs require upgrading to [fluid=nso-adv-space-slurry].\n\n[item=nso-promethium-147] is obtained from [item=promethium-asteroid-chunk], and is required for all platform science recipes.\n\n[entity=medium-promethium-asteroid] now appear between planet routes, meaning to create science you will need to keep the platform moving between planets. If you're struggling to get enough [item=nso-promethium-147], consider slowing down your platform to give yourself more time to gather promethium, try stockpiling [fluid=nso-space-slurry] while you aren't using promethium to craft packs, or just make a wider platform.\n\nAll forms of promethium spoil now, so stationary platforms will quickly run out of material to work with. Noteably this also affects [item=promethium-science-pack], which requires [item=nso-hg-promethium-asteroid-chunk] only found from the large asteroids near the shattered planet.\n\n[entity=medium-promethium-asteroid] have twice the health of normal asteroids, and appear in addition to normal spawns. In order to not completely overwhelm platform turrets, both small and medium promethium asteroids are highly vulnerable to [entity=laser-turret]. For best results, you will want both types of turrets on your platforms.\n\nNote that specifically for [item=agricultural-science-pack], crafting is affected by the freshness of promethium. This recipe requires less promethium than others to make it easier, but you risk wasting a large amount of effective science if you don't apply Gleba princibles to your platform here. Keep belts moving, and throw out unused promethium!
nso-tech=As most early game science packs are now gone, all tech normally unlocked at chemical science is now unlocked from the start. Stat bonuses provided by unlocked techs are now available as statpacks which can be unlocked as soon as you craft your first lab. They are seperated into [technology=nso-statpack-building] and [technology=nso-statpack-combat], and all future techs will branch off from one of these for easy navigating.\n\nUnlocking the first science pack is done through the [technology=space-science-pack] tech, which just requires you to power many labs for a long period of time. Early game, you will need to use the [item=nso-space-data] in labs to unlock the first few techs, the first of which will be [technology=kovarex-enrichment-process] to obtain the required uranium faster. Once you've unlocked at least one planet, you will be able to produce [item=space-science-pack].\n\nAll techs now have 1/5th of their original costs, thouch most packs are around 5x as expensive to craft, and research times are longer too. Infinite techs have been replaced with finite ones with relatively low caps, many requiring later packs to max out. For non-productivity techs, this cap is normally at 2-3 infinite tech levels in vanilla. Productivity techs are capped at 100%, with the final levels locked behind [technology=promethium-science-pack]. Exceptions are [technology=mining-productivity-6] and [technology=research-productivity]; the former has a few extra pre-infinite techs before it scales exponentially at promethium pack level, and the latter now just scales slightly faster than normal.\n\nNoteable damage breakpoints:\n - Big asteroids take nine rockets to break normally, six after [technology=refined-explosives-1] and three after [technology=refined-explosives-2].\n - Artillery techs have all been merged into one type: [technology=nso-artillery-improvements-1]. The second level allows killing max-evo biter nests in one-shot, and pentapod nests in two. Use quality turrets if you want even more range.\n - [technology=railgun-damage] is now locked behind promethium, meaning you will NOT be able to one-shot huge promethium asteroids initially. The tech also now boosts handheld and turret versions seperately, meaning quality ammo may be desired to deal with the huge demolishers as easily as before. Turrets should do enough damage to one-shot big stompers after researching the damage upgrade. (!!! Fact check, handheld?)
nso-removals=Some early game buildings have been removed due to starting at a higher tech level than normal; you will spawn with starting material to avoid being softlocked. Certain buildings have new recipes to reflect this, such as [recipe=fast-transport-belt] and [recipe=turbo-transport-belt]. A full list of changed and removed items can be found further below.\n\nSome removals have been done simply because I viewed the extra tiers as bloat. I imagine this is an unpopular opinion, so eventually I do plan on making these removals a configurable option in the mod.\n\nRemoved items:\n - a\n - b\n - c\n\nAdjusted items:\n - a\n - b\n - c\n - [recipe=fast-inserter]\n - [entity=assembling-machine-2]
