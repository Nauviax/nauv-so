Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2026.02.08
  Info:
    - This update introduces a new method to upcycle science, as an extra way to encourage larger platforms.
    - Technically no breaking changes, but bumped to 1.1.0 anyway because platforms may want to be redesigned.
  Changes:
    - Science packs can be upcycled at the cost of a small amount of slurry.
    - Oil refineries have a base quality bonus of 20% to accomplish this. Should not affect any other vanilla recipes.
    - Quality packs are less effective than vanilla, due to ease of upcycling. Rare packs are the new baseline. (Repair packs affected unfortunately)
    - Automation card techs reduced in price to avoid being impacted by quality changes. (Also Kovarex is cheaper to unlock.)
    - Agricultural science packs spoil in 1h again due to addition of quality stuff. Result is now eggs to avoid easy access to quality circuits etc.
    - Quality modules now give a small energy efficiency penalty.
    - Minor changes to recipe ordering in crafting tab.
    - Updated tips and tricks.

Version: 1.0.8
Date: 2026.01.31
  Info:
    - This update aims to slow down science production and decrease the effect of late-game productivity.
    - Mostly nerfs, a single Gleba buff. Existing saves will work fine, just slower.
  Changes:
    - Most recipes added by NSO have had their base craft times doubled.
    - Research speed tech bonus halved. Researching the first pack tech no longer provides a free research speed boost. (Overall, labs are half as fast)
    - Productivity in slurry, data and pack recipes are capped to 100%. Tooltips added to recipes to show this. (Otherwise late game the packs can be CHEAPER than vanilla!)
    - Science gel is capped at 0%, preventing any base productivity from having an effect. Recipes adjusted so the cost per gel remains mostly the same.
    - Nauvis gel can no longer be made in biochambers. Nauvis gel craft time halved.
    - Prod module 3 now has 8% productivity instead of 10%. All prod modules speed penalties doubled.
    - Speed module 3 now has 40% boost instead of 50%.
    - Garbage data cards from pack crafting are now affected by productivity again and will show in production graph stats. Recycling garbage data gives 33% less material.
    - Agricultural science packs take twice as long to spoil. (Data spoil time is unchanged.)
    - Updated tips and tricks.
    - Blank data recipe tooltip now shows "Made in".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 2026.01.09
  Changes:
    - Gleba data weight halved, and both pack and data now spoil into garbage data.
    - Gleba plant spores per harvest reduced from 15 to 10 due to larger amount needed for progression. May revisit this amount again later.
    - Fulgora data density doubled; Seemed a little too much.
    - Updated tips slightly
    - Added placeholder thumbnail to mod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2026.01.07
  Changes:
    - Disallowed prod modules in gel recipies. Mainly to keep science requirements more consistent for higher levels of productivity.
    - Gel craft times increased by 150%. (Partially to encourage speed modules now that prod is gone.)
    - Data craft times increased slightly. Vulcanus craft times 50% larger on top due to foundry base speed.
    - Fulgora science rebalanbce to require less bricks and more batteries.
    - Nauvis gel requires more uranium and flamethrower ammo.
    - Vulcanus gel requires more carbide and concrete.
    - Gleba gel requires more coal and nutrient.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2026.01.02
  Changes:
    - Blank data cost and craft time increaced, can now output duds.
    - Plastic costs for gels increased. Lube for Fulgora gel and acid for Vulcanus gel increased.
    - Fulgora science recipe tweaks, and data density significantly reduced. Additionally requires ~1.5x rocket launches.
    - Cryo science requires more rocket fuel, but solid fuel replaced with small amount of lube.
    - Stack size of most data cards halved.
    - Locale file names renamed from old placeholder names.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2026.01.01
  Changes:
    - Pack crafting now takes an additional simple ingredient unique to each pack.
    - Vulcanus gel now takes twice as much concrete.
    - Fixed years in previous changelog dates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2025.12.28
  Changes:
    - Slurry now takes iron sticks instead of water, and requires more thruster fuel. Starfrost slurry output reduced.
    - Promethium 147 per chunk halved. Reverted oxide chunk ice output to normal levels.
    - Fluoroketone use increased in most relevant science recipes. Minor gel cost increaces.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2025.12.27
  Changes:
    - Nauvis space routes now only have small promethium asteroids. Now more resistant to lasers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2025.12.17
  Changes:
    - Weight of data and science increased tenfold, to require more rocket parts per pack. (Cryo just x5)
    - Slightly longer gel craft times
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025.12.16
  Changes:
    - Changelog added, version 1.0 set
